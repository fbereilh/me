    "5. **Learning loop** – tracks actual vs estimated time to improve predictions  \n",

    "\n",
    "LangChain is a framework for building applications with LLMs. Its key concepts are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Models** – wrappers around LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)\n",
    "2. **Tools** – functions the LLM can call (like checking your calendar)\n",
    "3. **Agents** – LLMs that decide *which* tools to use and *when*\n",
    "4. **Chains** – sequences of steps piped together\n",
    "\n",
    "For our scheduling agent, we'll mainly use **Tools** and **Agents** — the LLM will decide when to estimate time, check the calendar, or schedule a task.\n"
